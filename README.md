# Topic Analysis of Review Data
### Objectives
- To assist a major mobile brand in comprehending the
voice of the consumer and the subjects that customers are
discussing by examining the product reviews on Amazon
- To use machine learning and Python to comprehend
customer voice and forecast the review rating based on
Amazon's product
- To perform topic modeling on specific parts of speech
- To interpret the emerging topics using customer voice

### Prerequisites
- Data exploration: It is used to find trends and patterns or to check
assumptions by analyzing data with visual tools.
- POS tagging: It is used in text analysis tools and algorithms as well as
corpus searches.
- Model creation: It uses Pythonâ€™s backend to create a sequential
model.
- Python: It is widely used to implement data analysis and machine
learning.
- Topic modeling: It is used to discover the themes that run through a
corpus by analyzing the words of the original texts.
- LDA: It is used as a preprocessing step in machine learning and it is
mainly used for classification problems.
- NLTK: It is a platform used for building Python programs that work
with human language data for applications in statistical natural
language processing (NLP).

### Dataset Description
- Variable - Description
- Sentiment - The sentiment against the review (4- and 5-star
reviews are positive, and 1-, 2-, and 3-star reviews
are negative)
- Reviews - The main text of the review

### Steps:
Discover the topics in the reviews, and present them to the business in
a consumable format by utilizing syntactic processing and topic
modeling techniques.
Perform specific cleanup and POS tagging and add restrictions to
relevant POS tags. Then, perform topic modeling using LDA. Finally,
give business-friendly names to the topics, and make a table for the
business.
1. Read the .csv file using Pandas, and look at the first few top records
2. Normalize the casing of the review text, and extract the text into a
list for easier manipulation.
3. Tokenize the reviews using NLTK's word_tokenize function
4. Perform parts-of-speech tagging on each sentence using the NLTK
POS tagger
5. For the topic model, include nouns only
- Find all POS tags that correspond to nouns
- Limit the data to terms with these tags
6. Lemmatize
- The different forms of the terms need to be treated as one
- For the time being, there is no need to provide a POS tag to the
lemmatizer
7. Remove stopwords and punctuations (if any)
8. Create a topic model using LDA on the cleaned-up data with 12 topics
- Print the top terms for each topic
- Find the coherence of the model with the c_v metric
9. Analyze the topics through the business lens
- Determine which of the topics can be combined
10. Create a topic model using LDA with what you think is the optimal
number of topics
- Find the coherence of the model
11. Businesses should be able to interpret the topics.
- Name each of the identified topics
- Create a table with the topic names and the top ten terms in each
to present to the business
